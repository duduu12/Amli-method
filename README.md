# Amli-method
When using machine learning methods to make predictions, the problem of small sample sizes or highly noisy observation samples is common. Current mainstream sample expansion methods cannot handle the data noise problem well. In this regard, we propose an adaptive multipath linear interpolation (AMLI) method to solve insufficient prediction sample sizes or large errors between observed samples and actual distribution. The rationale of the AMLI method is to divide the original feature space into several subspaces with equal samples, randomly extract a sample from each subspace as a class, and then perform linear interpolation on the samples in the same class (i.e., K-path linear interpolation). After the AMLI processing, valid samples are greatly expanded, the sample structure adjusted, and the average noise of the samples reduced so that the prediction effect of the machine learning model is improved. The hyperparameters of this method have an intuitive explanation and usually require little calibration. We compared the proposed method with a variety of machine learning prediction methods and demonstrated that the AMLI method can significantly improve the prediction result.
